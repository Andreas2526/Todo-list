# Todo-list
---------------------------
**How the program works!**
This is a ToDo List and you can write any task you have on your mind!
To get a task shown on the page simply write something in the input field that is shown with (TaskName...)
To complete a task simply press on the selected row and it will check it and do an overline to show that it is completed.
The counter will keep track of how many tasks you have and how many you have completed.
----------------------------
**How to Run the program**
To open and run the program simply open the file that says "Todo.html".
